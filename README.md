# RiskGame

Master will have the 4 classes, and first functionality, as well as first stage of the game.
That is each player place their armies across the map
You can test this functionality by play the web game (the one he gave us), and our game at the same time. And place armies in our game
the same way as you placed in the web game.
You can either place armies by enter territory's name or their index number (the map that has index numbers and name can be found in 
the repo).
After done placing armies, you can use 3 commands that I already implemented:
  -la: to display every player's owned territoies, and free territories
  -lm: to display your owned territories, and free territories
  -lav: to display free territories
  Note that: the number next to each territory is the number of army each player has on that territory
Test it carefully.

Branch SetTerritory: Fix some bugs, and update the way the game display on console window to be more organized. Additionally, 2 more
commands are added (-shde: to detail about a territory, and -map: draw visual map)
